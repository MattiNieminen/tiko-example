;; Map (function, not the data structure)
;;

;; Getting a list of all series names

(defn series-name
  [s]
  (get s :name))

(map series-name series)

;; Simpler: (keywords can work as functions)

(map :name series)


;;
;; Filter
;;

;; Getting a list of series, where :genre is :horror

(defn horror?
  [s]
  (= :horror (:genre s)))

(filter horror? series)

;;
;; Reduce
;;

;; Get the sum of episodes for all series

(reduce + (map :episode-count series))


;;
;; Exercise 3. Get the amount of shows which have :action as :genre
;;


;;
;; Exercise 4. Combine map, filter and reduce to get the total amount of
;; episodes in all series where :genre is :action. Write a helper function
;; action? which takes a single series as parameter and use that with filter.
