## Development

Open terminal, go to the working directory and run:

```bash
lein develop
```

Then open your IDE, and start a new repl from there. Use ```(reset)```
to start the server, and reset it when you make changes to the backend.
The frontend will update automatically when files are saved.

## Deployment

Open terminal, go to the working directory and run:

```bash
lein production
```

This will produce an uberjar, which you run with command:

```bash
java -jar target/uberjar/tiko-example-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```
